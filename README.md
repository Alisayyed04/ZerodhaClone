# ZerodhaClone

## Got the basic setup completed

frontend and backend are working together fine

### Creating a new branch called frontendDev

focusing on creating frontend first then will be focusing on backend

Added the footer and navbar component and created the file structure as well completed the frame for landing page

added other pages aswell completed the basic setup for all of them , next is styling and connecting them to backend

//flow right now 
make the html 
then move to css 
then add react components whereever needed 
then move to backend 

so my approach is frontend first then backend
